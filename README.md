An A/V remote for the Pioneer VSX-S520 A/V Receiver and one or two Viewsonic CDE4302 commercial monitors 

Goals:
* Mobile form factor web UI
* Turn everything on or off
* Set A/V volume and input
* Mute audio
* Python/Flask backend communicates using Pioneer IP and Viewsonic RS232 protocols

Current status:
* Mockup of UI
* Volume slider sends to backend, which receives volume requests
* Nothing actually does anything...
