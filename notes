Updates from javascript to REST are very fast, interactive, probably better than 10Hz, more like 20Hz.
Updates through eiscp python frontend "onkyo" are very slow, on the order of 2 Hz to 1 Hz.
Updates through eiscp python module from within python are reasonably fast, like 5Hz to 10Hz. 
So why is the system front-to-back so laggy?
Removed asynchrony in backend and, with discard of outdated status, is now pretty responsive in frontend.

More responsive volume control in Javascript
    100msec updates while dragging, send most recent
    if(get_updates) { update status every 2 seconds }
    set interval timer on click
        dragging_volume = true
	get_updates = false
    in interval timer:
	send current volume
	set interval timer
    on release
	delete interval timer
	send current volume
	dragging_volume = false
	get_updates = true
